This module provide a simple abstraction AWS command line interface for Amazon's EC2 compute web service.

If you encounter a feature of EC2 you want that's not implemented by this module (and there are many), please consider sending a pull request.

## Getting Started

- apt-get update && apt-get install aws-cli
- aws configure _[enter your config here]_
- zef install CLI::AWS::EC2-Simple
- raws-ec2 _[enter your commands here]_

## Usage

```
./raws-ec2 [--id=<Str>] [--nsu] [--eip] [-y] <cmd>
  
    <cmd>         One of <list launch setup connect state terminate nuke>
    --id=<Str>    Running InstanceId of form 'i-0785d8bd98b5f458b'
    --nsu         No setup (suppress launch from running setup)
    --eip         Allocates (if needed) and Associates Elastic IP
    -y            Silence confirmation <nuke> cmd only
```

Will make an (e.g.) ```MyKeyPair1672164025.pem``` from your credentials in your $*HOME dir

## Config

```launch``` reads ```aws-ec2-launch.yaml``` which is preloaded with the standard AWS Canonical, Ubuntu, 22.04 LTS, amd64 jammy image build on 2022-12-01.
Edit this yaml file to meet your needs...

- cat .raws-config/aws-ec2-launch.yaml 

```
instance:
    image: 'ami-0f540e9f488cfa27d'
    type: 't2.micro'
    security-group:
        name: 'MySG'
        rules:
            - inbound:
                port: 80
                cidr: '0.0.0.0/0'
            - inbound:
                port: 443 
                cidr: '0.0.0.0/0'
```

## Setup

```setup``` deploys docker, docker-compose, raku and zef to the launchee...

- cat .raws-config/launch.pl

```
#!/usr/bin/perl
`sudo apt-get update -y`;

`sudo apt-get install rakudo -y`;
`sudo git clone https://github.com/ugexe/zef.git`;
`sudo raku -I./zef zef/bin/zef install ./zef --/test`;

`sudo apt-get install docker -y`;
`sudo apt-get install docker-compose -y`;
```

## Wordpress Deploy & Control

[This section will probably go into raku-CLI-WP-Simple]

viz. [digital ocean howto](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-with-docker-compose#step-3-defining-services-with-docker-compose)

- client script 'raku-wp --launch'


## NOTES

- unassigned Elastic IPs are chargeable ($5 per month ish), may be better to run one free tier instance
- rules about rules
  - will always open port 22 (SSH) inbound from this client IP
  - will re-use the existing named Security Group (or create if not present)
  - only inbound are supported for now 
  -  if you want to keep the name and change the rules, then delete via the aws console
